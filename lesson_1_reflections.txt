【1】How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    compare the rows thst have been added or deleted.

【2】How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    retrieve the previous version when current is deviated, or summarize the process 
    of programming.

【3】What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually chooseing is more precise, more logical division to the version 
    change, applicable to programs and other technical documents,while 
    automatically ves suitable for literary records.

【4】Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because if you modify a file in history version, it won't affect other versions
    of the same file.

【5】How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    find the id of commit by using get log, and then compare one with older.

【6】How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it keeps the old correct version so that I can rollback anytime

【7】Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    edit the code file with sublime, commit and checkout it from repository

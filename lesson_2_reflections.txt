【1】What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory created, for build some snapshot of current files.

【2】How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area keeps some individual parts of changes to commit to
repository together. It offers the integrity of logic.


【3】How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
make a commit before a new logic start.

【4】What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
When tring a new version from a old commit, meanwhile keep the old version of the change

【5】How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
the diagram shows the relationsships between branches, and the parent-child
relationship between commits.

【6】What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
Two branch's commit will be mixed into one branch, the git log will contains
all of the two branch's commit, and the combined code and file contains all
changes.

【7】What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
The automatic merging can't resolve conflict, but will merges the effective
changes. If always merge manually, will deal with large amounts of changes,but
resolve conflicts precisely.

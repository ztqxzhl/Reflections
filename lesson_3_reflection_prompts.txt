When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I change working environment, I'd like clone from github rather than
copy the project from one computer to another.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I might be in process of editing when up-to-date automatically

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks and Clones are copy the entire code repository, while Forks are copy
between users in github, but Clones are copy from github to local. Branches 
are different versions of the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's makes me working with lastest content of remote repository, easy to
 compare and avoid conflict.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub, all collaborators must work on one repostory, the 
process must be up-to-date every time. Git or GitHub is more simply to
cooperate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    In one function, I'd rather make more step than one commit to finish it.
So separate to a new branch and commit entirely will be more integrately. The
only benefit of make changes in master is simply, not need the pull request.

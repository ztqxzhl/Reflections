When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I change working environment, I'd like clone from github rather than
copy the project from one computer to another.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks and Clones are copy the entire code repository, while Forks are copy

stored locally?

    It's makes me working with lastest content of remote repository, easy to
 compare and avoid conflict.
